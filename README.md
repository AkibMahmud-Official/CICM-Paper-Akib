This is the C++ code used for analysis in the paper titled "A Multi-objective Global Optimization Approach for Vibration and Cost Minimization of a Reinforced Concrete Tall Building" published in the Second International Civil Infrastructure and Construction Material Conference at MILITARY INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MIST), Dhaka.
The multi-objective optimization is performed by employing the NLopt nonlinear-optimization package, specically the ISRES (Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy) algorithm.
The GeneralizedSelfAdjointEigenSolver for eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis to determine building top deflection and Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) deflection.
